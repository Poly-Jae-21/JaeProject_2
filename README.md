# Goal
The main aim of this algorithm is to develop an optimal distributed urban charging 
network planning under micro-grid concept. 
The optimal charging network planning is determined by one main goal (optimal locations)
and influenced by multiple main criteria with sub criteria. These multiple factors 
can be applied to develop the optimal planning using geospatial multiple criteria 
decision making approach (MCDM). MCDM approach is for analyzing the spatial relationship
between multiple criteria and prioritizing/finding the suitability locations of EVCS through 
pairwise comparison/ranking method. However, this approach is determined by weight,
initial weight, created by survey from expert groups. This survey is mutable depending on
expert groups, target cities, and researchers. Thus, this approach has limitations of 
robustness, generality, and applicability. 

To solve these problem and implement of the optimal charging network planning, 
we utilized three techniques: 



i) Deep PPO reinforcement learning, 
ii) meta-learning-based multi-policies learning, 
iii) geospatial analysis, and 
iv) parallel learning.
